# quick-and-simple-beginner-projects
This will be a folder of quick and simple beginner projects I think up of for fun. I am thinking of making a code along series on youtube where I will build these in real time.
1. constrainedinput.py:
This quick project is supposed to simulate a social media bio where there is a maximum amount of characters. Very simple to make yet that does not mean it is not fun or extremely easy either, the coder must still juggle a couple of moving parts... here is a demo:

2. findandreplace.py:
This quick project is supposed to simulate a the find and replace feature we can find in many text apps. For now it really only works when you work on text that you have written in real time, but hey why not make it work for text that you copy and paste from the web! Demo:

3. virtualplotter.py: 
This is a good introduction to the 'graph' object from pysimplegui. Probably my favorite element, especially since it blows the door open on the type of projects you can make with PSG. Go check out my repositories named: 'MIMI' and/or 'mindmap' for different mindmap applications that use this graph element. This virtual plotter tells you in real time where the current point on the line is, and moves the point up the y=x line if you press 'j' and down if you press 'k'. Try it out. Demo:

Note: A lot of inspiration is drawn from the PySimpleGUI Demo projects, I will be implementing all these projects with my own ideas and ways of implementation but if the concepts seem eerily familiar that is probably because I have read A LOT of demo projects in my day. The demo programs I speak of can be found here: https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/DemoPrograms

# quick-and-simple-beginner-projects
This will be a folder of quick and simple beginner projects I think up of for fun. I am thinking of making a code along series on youtube where I will build these in real time.
# Javascript: 
### 1. app.js, index.html -- similar to the pysimplegui find and replace app, will find and replace a word you wish to replace from the text you provided in the text area. Features: Clear, copy, find, replace, word count, character count. 
Demo:

# Python (PysimpleGUI)
### 1. constrainedinput.py:
This quick project is supposed to simulate a social media bio where there is a maximum amount of characters. Very simple to make yet that does not mean it is not fun or extremely easy either, the coder must still juggle a couple of moving parts... here is a demo:

### 2. findandreplace.py:
This quick project is supposed to simulate a the find and replace feature we can find in many text apps. For now it really only works when you work on text that you have written in real time, but hey why not make it work for text that you copy and paste from the web! Demo:

### 3. virtualplotter.py: 
This is a good introduction to the 'graph' object from pysimplegui. Probably my favorite element, especially since it blows the door open on the type of projects you can make with PSG. Go check out my repositories named: 'MIMI' and/or 'mindmap' for different mindmap applications that use this graph element.
This virtual plotter tells you in real time where the current point on the line is, and moves the point up the y=x line if you press 'j' and down if you press 'k'. Try it out. Demo:

### 4. dragging.py:
Did I mention that I love the graph object?? My god is this an amazing feauture, I wish I had discovered it long ago. Anyways, I just figured out one implementation of the 'dragging' objects on the canvas while writing this out. So much fun! I need to add this functionality to my 'MIMI' and 'mindmap' applications. 
Demo:

### 5. econpy.py:
Just some more graph fun. Demo:

### 6. enhancedplotter.py:
This is a program where you use the user input to plot observations onto the graph. you practice getting user input, creating a plotting graph, plotting the elements and have some fun with the random.randint() function to increase the variability between observations. Fantastic. 
Demo:

### 7. tangency.py:
This one was so much fun to make, anyone who has taken calculus will surely love this one. This plots the tangency line at the given x point on the y = x^2 curve we have plotted. The beauty of this is that (like all the other projects in this repo) we made this from scratch using only the pysimplegui canvas -- no external plotting library or anything. It shows how much we can do with this module. Check it out! 
Demo:

### 8 surveybuilderdemo.py:
Code along with me and make this survey building application from scratch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7PnELO1knw

Note: A lot of inspiration is drawn from the PySimpleGUI Demo projects, I will be implementing all these projects with my own ideas and ways of implementation but if the concepts seem eerily familiar that is probably because I have read A LOT of demo projects in my day. The demo programs I speak of can be found here: https://github.com/PySimpleGUI/PySimpleGUI/tree/master/DemoPrograms
